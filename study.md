# Rails: ActiveRecord Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Active Record Basics — Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
-   [ActiveRecord::Base](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)
-   [Active Record Migrations — Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

## Explain why an ORM is valuable

In your own words, define ORM and explain why using an ORM is valuable.

```md
ORM is object relational mapping. I don't know how it works exactly, but it
seems to persist data and allows for normal object-oriented syntax in a
database context.
```

## Name model files and classes

Suppose I have an entity called "Person" that represents people in my
application. What would I name the file where I define the model for this
entity?

```md
person.rb
```

What would I name the class for this entity?

```md
Person
```

What would I name the database table for this entity?

```md
people
```

## Reference documentation for CRUD

Which ActiveRecord method creates new objects? Does this method persist objects
as rows in the database, or is there another required method for persistence?

```md
Class.new creates new objects. To persist the object, .save can be called on it
or .create can be called from the start to both create and save the object.
```

Which ActiveRecord method finds all records of a certain type (or entity)?

```md
.all
```

## Explain the role of migrations

In your own words, define migrations and explain why developers use them.

```md
Again, I'm unclear on what exactly this is (sorry, it's late). It appears to be
some sort of version control, but it's also creating things.
```

## Reference documentation for migrations

In ActiveRecord Migrations, what is the name of the method the creates a new
table?

```md
create_table
```

What is the name of the method that creates a new column?

```md
add_column
```

I want to create a table called `pets` with columns `name` and `breed`, both
strings. `name` cannot be blank and must be unique. Write the migration you
would use to satisfy these requirements.

```ruby
$ rails generate model Pet name:string breed:string
```

## Explain the role of seed data

In your own words, explain the role of application seed data.

```md
Seed data populates the database with dummy data.
```

Should you use seeds to create data to experiment with during development?

```md
I would think so, but it's probably best to remove the seeds before deployment.
```
