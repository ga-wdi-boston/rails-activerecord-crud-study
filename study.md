# Rails: ActiveRecord Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Active Record Basics â€” Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
    (up to and including chapter 6)

## Additional Resources
-   [ActiveRecord::Base](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)
-   [Object-relational mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)

## Explain Why an ORM Is Valuable

In your own words, define ORM and explain why using an ORM is valuable.

```md
Object Relational Mapping or ORM gives our application the ability to map our
objects to tables in a DB.  It handles the actual writing and reading into the
DB, there are no SQL statements need to be written by the developer. ORM handles
modeling of our objects and the dependencies between them. ORM has the ability
to validate our data as well before it is persisted to the DB.

This is valuable for many reasons, one of which is the ability to quickly
build an object-oriented data model without knowing the ins and outs of a DB.
This proven model is time tested(bug free) and allows us to focus on building
out our application. It is a industry standard framework, making supporting
our app straight forward.

```

## Naming Models

Suppose that there is an entity called "Person" that represents people in an
application. What should be the name of the file where the model for this entity
is defined?

```md
person.rb
```

## Naming Classes

What should be the name of the class that represents this entity?

```md
Person
```

## Naming Database Tables

What should be the name of the database table for this entity?

```md
persons
```

## Objects and Persistence

Which ActiveRecord method creates new objects? Does this method persist objects
as rows in the database, or is there another method required for persistence?

```md
create
This does persist the object and no other method is required.
```

## Retrieving Records

Which ActiveRecord method finds all of the records of a certain type (or
entity)?

```md
all
```

## Rails Console

For the subsequent questions, assume that we are in the Rails console (by
entering `bin/rails console` in the terminal) and that the model names follow
Rails's naming conventions.  e.g., The name of the model for a "people"
collection would be "Person".

## Create

Create the following movies with the given attributes.

| id | title | rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Battlefield Earth | 2.4 |
| 1 | Sharknado | 3.3 |
| 2 | The Core | 5.4 |

```ruby
When creating an ActiveRecord with .new, .create or create!,
you cannot set the ID attribute, it is protected

If you don't care what the ID is

Movie.create({title: 'Battefield Earth', rating: 2.4})
Movie.create({title: 'Sharknado, rating: 3.3})
Movie.create({title: 'The Core', rating: 5.4})

```

## Read

From the following collection of organisms, find the record with "Red Panda" as
its `common_name`, find all records of organisms belonging to the `phylum`
Mollusca, and find the last record.

| id | common_name | binomial_name | phylum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Mystery Snail | Pomacea bridgesii | Mollusca |
| 1 | Red Panda | Ailurus fulgens | Chordata |
| 2 | Stubby Squid | Rossia pacifica | Mollusca |

```ruby
Organism.find_by(common_name: 'Red Panda')
Organism.where(phylum: 'Mollusca')
Organism.last

```

## Update

From a collection of galaxies, update the `name` attribute of the record with
the `designation` attribute of "NGC 224" to "Andromeda".

```ruby
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12413599/intelligent-plural-always-intelligent
galaxy = Galaxy(name: 'designation')
galaxy.'NGC 224', 'Andromeda')
galaxy.save
```

## Delete

From a collection of characters, delete the record with the `id` attribute of 4.

```ruby
character = Character.find_by(id: '4')
character.destroy

```
